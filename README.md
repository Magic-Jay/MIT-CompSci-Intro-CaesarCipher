# CaesarCipher
MIT OpenCourse Assignment for fun 
buil coder, incoder, and decoder, to encrypt a text string with
  1. a single shift 
  2. multilayer shifts
  
And given any random encoded text string encrypted with above algorithm,
finding 
  a. the single shift it only one shift was applied and decrypt the text
  b. the multilayered shift which can be used to decrypt case a (this algorithm uses recursion and is being worked on)
